    <h2>MERCURY</h2>
    <p>
      Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to the Sun. It has extreme temperature
      variations, ranging from scorching heat of up to 430°C (800°F) in the day to freezing cold of -180°C (-290°F) at
      night. It has no atmosphere to retain heat and a heavily cratered surface, much like the Moon.

    <h2>VENUS</h2>
    <p>
      Venus is similar in size and composition to Earth, earning it the nickname "Earth's twin," but it has a thick
      atmosphere made mostly of carbon dioxide, leading to a runaway greenhouse effect. Temperatures on Venus are hot
      enough to melt lead, and the surface pressure is 92 times that of Earth’s. Venus rotates in the opposite direction
      to most planets (retrograde rotation).

    <h2>EARTH</h2>
    <p>
      Earth is the only known planet to support life, with liquid water, a breathable atmosphere, and a stable climate.
      It has a single natural satellite, the Moon. The surface is 71% water, with continents and oceans. Earth's
      magnetic field protects it from solar radiation.

    <h2>MARS</h2>
    <p>
      Known as the "Red Planet" due to its reddish appearance from iron oxide (rust) on its surface. Mars has the
      largest volcano in the Solar System, Olympus Mons, and a massive canyon system called Valles Marineris. The
      atmosphere is thin, composed mostly of carbon dioxide, and Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos. It is a
      target for future human exploration due to its potential to support life in the past

    <h2>JUPITER</h2>
    <p>
      Jupiter is the largest planet in the Solar System, with a composition mostly of hydrogen and helium. It has a
      famous Great Red Spot, which is a storm larger than Earth that has been raging for centuries. Jupiter has at least
      79 moons, including Ganymede, the largest moon in the Solar System, and Europa, which may have an ocean beneath
      its icy crust

    <h2>SATURN</h2>
    <p>
      Saturn is famous for its elaborate ring system, composed of ice, rock, and dust. It is also a gas giant like
      Jupiter, mostly made of hydrogen and helium. Saturn has 83 moons, including Titan, the second-largest moon in the
      Solar System, which has a thick atmosphere and lakes of liquid methane and ethane on its surface.

    <h2>URANUS</h2>
    <p>
      Uranus is unique because it rotates on its side, possibly due to a giant collision early in its history. Its
      atmosphere consists mainly of hydrogen, helium, and methane, giving it a blue-green color. Uranus has a faint ring
      system and 27 known moons, with Miranda being the most unusual, displaying dramatic surface features

    <h2>NEPTUNE</h2>
    <p>
      Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun and is known for its deep blue color, resulting from methane in its
      atmosphere. It has the strongest winds in the Solar System, reaching up to 2,100 km/h. Neptune has 14 known moons,
      with Triton being the largest, and is thought to have a subsurface ocean beneath its icy crust.

    <h2>PLUTO</h2>
    <p>
      Pluto has an elliptical orbit and a thin atmosphere primarily composed of nitrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide.
      Its surface is covered with ice and rock, featuring the famous heart-shaped Tombaugh Regio. Pluto has five moons,
      with Charon being the largest. Once considered the ninth planet, Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006
      due to its inability to clear its orbit. It was closely studied by NASA's New Horizons mission in 2015

    <h2></h2>
    <p>
      A solar system is a collection of celestial objects, including a star (such as the Sun), planets, moons,
      asteroids, comets, and other smaller bodies, all held together by gravity. Planets orbit the star, and in our
      solar system, there are eight planets, with Earth being the third from the Sun. The outer planets are gas giants,
      while the inner planets are rocky. Other components include moons, dwarf planets like Pluto, and smaller objects
      found in the asteroid belt or the Oort Cloud. Solar systems are formed from clouds of gas and dust, and many have
      been discovered around other stars (exoplanetary systems).
